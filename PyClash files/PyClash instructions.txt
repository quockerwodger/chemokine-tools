Welcome to PyClash! This python script will allow you to automate the identification of steric clashes, charge repulsion/attraction and missing interface contacts

Before running PyClash, the following input files need to be generated:

Clash pdb
- A pdb file containing the structure to be analysed for clashes. For this workflow, it has been generated by using a known binding model as a template to insert a non-binding protein into the binding site
- Crystal structures can cause problems when they contain unusual atoms or 'anisou'
	- I modelled each chemokine in AlphaFold as a monomer, used the top three for my analyses

Clash pqr
- A pqr file generated from the clash pdb, can be done at https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr or through the command line if the relevant tools are installed
- Settings I used: PROPKA = yes, AMBER forcefield, internal naming scheme, Additional options: Add/keep chain IDs in PQR file, remove waters from the output file

Template pdb
- The template model used to generate the clash pdb (i.e. the known binding model)

All of these files, plus the PyClash script, need to be within the same folder for this to work.

Once the setup is done, run PyClash using the command line with the following script:
python pyclash.py

You will be prompted to input a few values:
Resolution - The spacing of points along the central plane of the spheres generated for each atom. This needs to be an even number. In testing, '20' was used and provided good results
Clash pdb - The name of the clash pdb, must be added as 'name.pdb'
Clash pqr - The name of the clash pqr, must be added as 'name.pqr'
Template pdb - The name of the template pdb, must be added as 'name.pdb'

Results analysis
- Always inspect the structures produced! This script does occasionally produce incorrect results. If this occurs, simply rerun the script and it should produce the correct results
- Charge force cutoff: I selected residues with a |force| > 1.0 (i.e. more than +1.0 or less than -1.0
- Steric clash cutoff: I selected residues with > 15% volume clash
