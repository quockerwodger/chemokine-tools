## Interface Finder ##

This simple script will take a series of input structures, find the interface residues in each, and return a spreadsheet with them

Workflow
- When analysing an MD trajectory, I created a seperate pdb file for each frame within VMD with the following tcl script:
	set sel [atomselect top "all"]
	set num_frames [molinfo top get numframes]
	for {set i 0} {$i < $num_frames} {incr i} {
		$sel frame $i
		set outfile "frame_$i.pdb"
		$sel writepdb $outfile
		}
	$sel delete
- You need to create a text file containing the names of each pdb being analysed. The easiest way to do this is to have them all within a single directory, navigate to here within the console and run the command
	dir /s/b/o:gn > filenames.txt
- The resulting file will need to be trimmed a bit to shorten the directory trees (only the directory containing the pdb's is required) and remove 'filenames.txt' from the list
- When running the program, will be prompted to provide the file list, which will be the text file with all pdbs
- The script will open each item, find all residue-residue contacts that are < 8.0 A and add them to a table, along with their distance for that particular frame
- This table is output as 'distance table.csv'
	- As this is simply outputting all residue-residue pairs it can find, several residues will be duplicated. It is up to you to process that, I did it within R.
